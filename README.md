# CoopCodingRate
Source code for simulations, supplementing the part of the article "Cooperative coding of continuous variables in networks with sparsity constraint" that deals with rate networks


## Content
- cooperative_coding_simulations.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for running the simulations of 1D and 2D cooperatively coding rate networks that are either excitatory, balanced or use spike frequency adaptation (SFA).
- cooperative_coding_plotting.ipynb: Notebook for generating Figs. 3-7 from the article.
- data/plot_data.h5: HDF5 file containing the data required to replicate the plots
